Hi,

I hope you're doing well!

I came across your Minecraft username and was wondering if you'd ever consider parting with the account. I know this might be unexpected, but I thought I'd reach out and ask politely.

Also just to let you know, your username is tied to an email within a collection of public pastes which is how people have gotten your contact info over the years (including me). I can show you where these pastes are if you'd like & how you'd get your info off of them.

If you're not interested, no worries at all ‚Äî just reply to me and I won't reach out again.

Thanks for your time!

Best regards,  
Akkae
